# array-sorter
A simple program in C++ that allows you to create an array and sort it from high to low or vice versa.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To view the code, open "main.cpp" found in the Array_sorter folder.
2. To run the game, run the "Array_sorter.exe" file in the Debug folder.

How to sort an array:

1. When asked, enter the amount of elements (i.e. how many numbers) you want in your array from 1 to 100.
2. After that, enter your desired values into your array. This process will be repeated until all elements specified in question 1. has been given a value.
3. You will now get a list of your current array.
4. You will be asked if you want to sort the array from the highest number to the lowest number. If you want that, type 'yes' (skip step 5).
5. If you chose 'no' in the previous question, you will get the option to sort the array from the lowest number to the highest number. If you want that, type 'yes'. If you don't want to sort your array at all you can type 'no' again.
6. Finally, if the array got sorted, the program will now print the sorted array.
